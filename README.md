# Social-Network-API

## Description

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Over the last part of this course, you’ll use several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications is data, it’s important that you understand how to build and structure the API first.

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. It use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## User Story
